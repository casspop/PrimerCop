# Parts List

These are the parts I used to put this together.  Some of them, like fasteners and standoffs, are from kits I have onhand which were purchased for other projects.

The 3mm (1/8") plate I used as the primary mounting plate is recycled VESA mount adapter plate from a flat panel display mounting kit I acquired years (decades!) ago.  As usual, I use what I have when I can.
