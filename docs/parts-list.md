# Parts List

These are the parts I used to put this together.  Some of them, like fasteners and standoffs, are from kits I have on hand which were purchased for other projects.

The 3mm (1/8") plate I used as the primary mounting plate is a recycled VESA mount adapter plate from a flat panel display mounting kit I acquired years (decades!) ago.  As usual, I use what I have when I can.

### The Parts

- [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17829?src=raspberrypi) - $4.00 - the 'W' is not needed for this project.
- [Drok Buck Converter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NALDSJ0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - $9.99 - 12vdc to 5vdc power supply.  Plug a 12vdc wall wart in and you're ready to go.  You do have a bunch of those in a box somewhere, right?  I use this power supply a lot in my Pi projects.
- [Adafruit IR break-beam sensors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2167) - $2.95 per set - Buy at least two sets, one for the top and one for the bottom.  I recommend having a spare in case you mess up.
- [SPST Momentary pushbuttons](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHCLHNKR?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) - $9.99 for 12 - Need three, but they're good to have on hand.  I like these with the pigtail already soldered on.  Convenient.
- [1602 LCD with i2c module](https://www.amazon.com/KEYESTUDIO-Display-Arduino-Raspberry-Stm32/dp/B0177XQE7K) - $9.99 - This is not the exact one I used, but they are very standardized, so it should be fine.
- [M3 Hex Socket Head screws](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J44YXV3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - $21.99 for 700 piece kit - You really need to have these on hand.
- [M2.5 Nylon Standoffs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D78PFQL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - $14.88 for 320 piece kit - Again, invaluable if you're doing much project work like this.
- [4" Zip Ties](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tiny+zip+ties&i=industrial&crid=2MHKZW6LKMY6K&sprefix=tiny+zip+ties%2Cindustrial%2C132&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) - $5-7 - Nothing special here.  Home Depot, Lowes, Ace Hardware.
- [Gorilla Mounting Tape](https://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Heavy-Double-Sided-Mounting/dp/B082TQ3KB5/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=gorilla+mounting+tape&qid=1670685796&sr=8-4) - $12.24 for 120 inches - This stuff is fantastic if you want a thing to stay where you put it.  Available nearly anywhere.
- [Stainless washers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OK7GPO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - $6.16 for 100 - Needed for articulating arm joints.  You can use other things, but these are what I have.
- [M3 Stainless NyLock Nuts](https://www.amazon.com/100Pcs-Stainless-Self-Lock-Inserted-Clinching/dp/B075ZZW7VL/ref=sr_1_9?crid=3GFZPK64KCOVJ&keywords=M3+x+0.5mm+Stainless+Steel+Nylock+Self-Locking+Nylon+Insert+Hex+Lock+Nuts&qid=1670686101&s=hi&sprefix=m3+x+0.5mm+stainless+steel+nylock+self-locking+nylon+insert+hex+lock+nuts%2Ctools%2C111&sr=1-9) - $6.99 for 100 - Use on articulating arm pivot points.
- [3/4" Aluminum angle stock 1/8" thick](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-3-4-in-x-36-in-Aluminum-Angle-with-1-8-in-Thick-801397/204273997) - $11.47 for 36" - Need about 2" of this, but again, it's good to have on hand.  Used for the switch mount.
