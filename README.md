# PrimerCop

## A primer watchdog for a Hornady Lock-n-Load AP press

12/8/22 - Version 2 of the Pi Pico software is working and available in the Code
section.

Three hardware buttons were added. Two of them allow for adding or subtracting 
from the 'primercount' variable.  The third button resets everything.

Debouncing the buttons is done in software, and works pretty good.

### Older notes

12/6/22 - Version 1 of PrimerCop is functioning.  It's not what I'd call ready
for prime time, but it does work.

I'm working on getting a set of 3 buttons added.  Designing the mounting
solution for the buttons is the task du jour.
