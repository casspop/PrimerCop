# OpenSCAD files.

Built with [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org).

These are the files I used to print the parts for PrimerCop.  

They are a bit tight on the hardware, but I was able to put it together.

I'm planning on adding about 1mm to the Drok power supply mount space as well
as the enclosure and faceplate for the LCD display.  I'll update these when
I do that, but it may be January or February 2023 before I get around to it.
